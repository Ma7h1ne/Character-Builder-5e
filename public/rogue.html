<h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly
and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can
deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with
an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The
attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.
You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another
enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t
incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the
attack roll.
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table
<br><br>
<h4>Expertise</h4>
At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or
one of your skill proficiencies and your proficiency with
thieves’ tools. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any
ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
proficiencies.<i>(Instructions on this later?)</i>
