##############################
##!! Adding a background !!##
############################
## The backgrounds were the last of this projet, and as a result, were implemented much better than classes/races,
## making it fairly easy to add content to down the road.
##
## The @master_hash is a hash(colletion) of hashes and is iterated through to generate the tabs and content 
## for the background selection. Adding to this hash with additional backgrounds and properties will 
## autogenerate the appropriate tabs by the area directly underneath the hash.
## 
## Any features that are to be automatically populated need to be highlighted with a div/span with the id of
## (backgroundname)_bg_features. If the background has a space, you'll need to use &nbsp; (reference Folk Hero)
## 
##
## NOTE: Due to the unique characterstic of each background, the bg_characteristics and bg_feature keys are used often
## as a dumping ground for filler content and unique bg things that don't fit any other key, 
## as you can see in the exiting backgrounds.  Whatever string info is put in those keys are simply evaluated at 
## the end of the content page as html, so feel adding tables, etc. is A-OK, just be careful of quotes.
# 
## Below is a template for reference, note: which values are strings and which ar arrays. ]
## All arrays contains strings only
