##############################
##!! Adding a background !!##
############################
## The backgrounds were the last of this projet, and as a result, were implemented much better than classes/races,
## making it fairly easy to add content to down the road.
##
## The @master_hash is a hash(colletion) of hashes and is iterated through to generate the tabs and content 
## for the background selection. Adding to this hash with additional backgrounds and properties will 
## autogenerate the appropriate tabs by the area directly underneath the hash.
## 
## NOTE: Due to the unique characterstic of each background, the bg_characteristics and bg_feature keys are used often
## as a dumping ground for filler content and unique bg things that don't fit any other key, 
## as you can see in the exiting backgrounds.  Whatever string info is put in those keys are simply evaluated at 
## the end of the content page as html, so feel adding tables, etc. is A-OK, just be careful of quotes.
# 
## Below is a template for reference, note: which values are strings and which ar arrays. ]
## All arrays contains strings only

      quasi-divine being, and work with your DM to detail the nature of your religious service. Appendix B contains a
      sample pantheon, from the Forgotten Realms setting. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
      childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call

      care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you must provide any material
      components needed for spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only you) at a
      modest lifestyle.

      to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you
      used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near

        <p>Criminals might seem like villains on the surface,
        and many of them are villainous to the core. But some
        have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming,
        characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but
        criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.<br>
        <h4>Variant Criminal: Spy</h4>
        <p>Although your capabilities are not much different
        from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned
        and practiced them in a very different context: as an
        espionage agent. You might have been an officially
        sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the
        secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder."
